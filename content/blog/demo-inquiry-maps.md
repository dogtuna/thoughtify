Before we prescribe training, we first ask: what’s actually preventing performance? Is it a skills gap, a workflow bottleneck, a tooling issue, or unclear goals? Our Inquiry Map guides you through a structured discovery to answer exactly that.

## How the Inquiry Map works

1. Define hypotheses — what might be causing the issue?
2. Collect evidence — stakeholder input, documents, and data.
3. Evaluate relationships — does each piece of evidence support, refute, or not relate to a hypothesis?
4. Decide next actions — confirm or pivot your solution approach.

## Why it matters

- Prevents “training by default” decisions.
- Surfaces non-training constraints early.
- Builds a clear narrative for sponsors and teams.

Whether you’re designing onboarding, compliance, or leadership development, inquiry helps you focus scarce resources on the highest‑leverage interventions.
